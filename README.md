# Personal Blog

## Your Task

In this challenge, we were taskes to create a two-page website where users will input and view blog posts. It includes building a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle. As you code, you'll gain practical JavaScript experience, explore the Document Object Model's power, and set the stage for more advanced tasks.

## User Story
This is an example of the final finished product, it allows the user to type a message and even gives an error in red at the bottom if one of the fields is not filled in.

This is an example of the toggle function changing to dark mode allowing for user preference.

On the blog page is not listed it will give a message that there are no blogs available.

When there is a post in the local storage it will appear and the error will not appear.

## Learning Points

This project taught me about the importants of learning the language of javascript and using many resources to find the answers. In this assignment I was able to use many properties of javascript such as the if --- else functions along with objects and methods. There is still a lot left to lear and I am excited to contiue down the path of the bootcamp.
